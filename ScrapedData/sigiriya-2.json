Am glad we took the challenge.. it's important that you reach there early otherwise it gets packed and you will have to q for long. We were there at 9am. Crowd was building up but was moving slowly. At the TOP, you will see ruins of a palace. Just red bricks stacked.. but the beauty is the view and to imagine the palace amd the amount of work and workers it would have taken to build such a place is incredible. A must go and if you get tired, feel free to rest or the exit point is in the middle before the mirror wall/spiral stair way where u may exit. Speaking about the spiral stairs.. I didn't personally like the walk up that steps.. just to see some paintings on the rock.. it's a small area. If you are an art lover, by all means..try It! Otherwise just walk straight towards the mirror wall.", "review_date": "February 28, 2018", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "1202 steps to the TOP!", "review_title": "1202 steps to the TOP!", "reviewer_name": "Shamla K", "num_reviews_reviewer": "27", "place_name": "Sigiriya World Heritage Site"},

We strongly advise anyone planning to visit to read up on the history of the rock which legend associates with the ancient Kingdom of the land. One can make the very challenging ascent of the rock up over a thousand steps (which we first did many years ago before the ascent was improved) and guides are available to explain the route and the history associated with it. Aside from the most incredible views, one can enjoy the fantastic historical frescoes and gardens. In the heat of the sun, the climb can be demanding. Water, hat and sunscreen are essential.

{"review_body": "This was my 2nd visit to Sigiriya, as the first time, in 2008, I had a bad knee so couldn't reach the top. This time I did, and it was spectacular! First you have to go to the museum to buy a ticket, which costs a shocking price of US$35, while local people pay about 10% of that. Next, there is a huge area of gardens, very well-kept with lakes and pools. This leads up to the Boulder Garden, where huge boulders and several caves are close to the base of the rock itself. From here you start to climb, masses of flights of steep steps at first, and then an iron spiral staircase which goes up to the Mirror Wall and the paintings of beautiful women. The paintings are gorgeous, but unfortunately you're not allowed to take photos. The mirror wall has lost its shine so it's hard to imagine what it looked like when it was first made hundreds of years ago. From here you have to walk along a narrow path attached to the rock, which is quite scary. Then it's more flights of steps up to the Lion Platform, a flat area where you can buy water etc. and have a rest before the final climb. I spent about half an hour here as there were tourists from so many different countries all taking photos, and it was really interesting to talk and share experiences. From here there are stone steps which rise up between the mighty lion's paws, and beyond the stone steps you reach a horrible iron staircase right up to the top, which is very scary indeed, and even worse on the way down! But it's really worth the effort, as the view from the very top is amazing. I was told that there's not much to see, but that isn't true. Although the actual palace and other buildings have long gone, there is so much impressive brickwork and so many staircases as different levels, as well as an enormous tank which looks like a large swimming pool. I spent about 2 hours climbing around the whole area of the top, and taking photos of the wonderful views to mountains, lakes and forest. It rained on and off, so the cloud and light effects were superb. The climb down the iron staircase was terrifying, but after reaching the lion platform, you can walk down to the bottom by a much quicker and easier route.

{"review_body": "This was my 2nd visit to Sigiriya, as the first time, in 2008, I had a bad knee so couldn't reach the top. This time I did, and it was spectacular! First you have to go to the museum to buy a ticket, which costs a shocking price of US$35, while local people pay about 10% of that. Next, there is a huge area of gardens, very well-kept with lakes and pools. This leads up to the Boulder Garden, where huge boulders and several caves are close to the base of the rock itself. From here you start to climb, masses of flights of steep steps at first, and then an iron spiral staircase which goes up to the Mirror Wall and the paintings of beautiful women. The paintings are gorgeous, but unfortunately you're not allowed to take photos. The mirror wall has lost its shine so it's hard to imagine what it looked like when it was first made hundreds of years ago. From here you have to walk along a narrow path attached to the rock, which is quite scary. Then it's more flights of steps up to the Lion Platform, a flat area where you can buy water etc. and have a rest before the final climb. I spent about half an hour here as there were tourists from so many different countries all taking photos, and it was really interesting to talk and share experiences. From here there are stone steps which rise up between the mighty lion's paws, and beyond the stone steps you reach a horrible iron staircase right up to the top, which is very scary indeed, and even worse on the way down! But it's really worth the effort, as the view from the very top is amazing. I was told that there's not much to see, but that isn't true. Although the actual palace and other buildings have long gone, there is so much impressive brickwork and so many staircases as different levels, as well as an enormous tank which looks like a large swimming pool. I spent about 2 hours climbing around the whole area of the top, and taking photos of the wonderful views to mountains, lakes and forest. It rained on and off, so the cloud and light effects were superb. The climb down the iron staircase was terrifying, but after reaching the lion platform, you can walk down to the bottom by a much quicker and easier route.

Sri Lanka is not a cheap country to visit compared with Thailand and other Asian countries, but it is beautiful and if you are visiting then some things just are worth paying for, and this is one of them. Climb was much easier than I thought it would be with a good staircase, wide treads and narrow risers which is what I pray for in a staircase. Great views from the top. Thought the remaining paintings of the five hundred concubines that weren't destroyed by later monks a glimpse into a very different royal way of life.

They will help you up and tell you all the history of the area. Our guy was a bit creepy...wouldn't stop touching us. And we really wanted to be alone. We finally told him to leave us alone and he cursed at us expecting payment. I would recommend starting at the museum so that you get all the history and context yourself.

An amazing creation from 5th Century served as military and royal purpose for King Kassapa. Some archeologisits hold a view that it's not a royal palace but a Buddhist monastery connected with deep religious functions. Whatever the debate, it's the most imposing and dramatic struture in Sri Lanka.Declared as World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982, Sigiriya is not a place to missed by anyone travelling in this country. It's better to start climbing vertiginous and circular staircase, sometimes with help of railings as early as possibly in the morning to avoid fierce heat. There is a ticket for all and for those from South Asia(they must carry the passport) to get ticket at concessional rate. On the way I was thrilled to see expansive landscape, remarkable frescoes and thick vegetation around including waterbodies and artificial terrrace gardens. It's a must to wear a hat and also a bottle of water and also apply sun screen lotion. Those with heart problems or any serious health issues should avoid the climb or consult their Physician well in advance. At the entrance before reaching the summit on a large platform one has to begin real ascent through two Lion's Paws( there used to be gigantic brick Lion but it no longer exist). There are mysterious ruins at the summit and also offer astonishing 365 degree view from the top. The Mirror Wall on the way contain unusual graffiti,inscriptions and erotic poems. While coming down one can see ancient caves like Cobra cave, Gardens and sculptured structures. After coming down it's a must to visit the Museum that provide excellent and reliable overview of life and times of ancient Sigiriya( same ticket is valid). There is also souvenir shop in the Museum also selling few well researched publications. There will be lots of guides hanging around but it can be avoided or better negotiate clear price before engaging such guides.

There aren't really any signposts for points of interest so the guide really did bring it to life. It is such a beautiful place and if you can make it up the 1502 steps then the views are well worthwhile. We went in the heat of the day which was crazy so I would recommend an early morning or evening visit.

In the heat and with no shade this was not a pleasant experience in fact many tourists had enough and walked back down.

When you make it to the top be aware of the monkeys that try and steal belongings! There is not much shade at the top so best to avoid midday sun, take plenty of water.

The frescoes midway are a sight to behold, along with the mirror wall. Try to be there before 8 am to avoid the noon heat. Wear comfortable footwear and preferably pants/shorts - dresses/frocks/skirts should be avoided as the sweeping winds throughout the climb and at the top might get you \"exposed\". Pack ample amount of drinking water and snacks but make sure these are carried in a back pack or cross body bags to ensure that both your hands are free to balance yourself during the climb. Ensure that your camera is securely slung around your neck or wrist. Gusts of wind sweeps in at unexpected places. Chances of dropping things are high. Umbrellas/hats wont be of any use because of the strong winds.....so be generous with the sunscreen :) We took nearly 4 hours to scale the rock and get back down.

We were immediately surrounded by men offering to act as 'guides' - it's difficult to say no! We finally gave in and had a fabulous tour of the area and naively felt we had been fortunate. That was until the guide demanded a payment of \u00a340 per person in pounds sterling. It all got very unpleasant and we gave him \u00a320 which was more than the usual level! We blame ourselves.

The woman at the ticket office, who spoken no English, pointed to the neraby Museum and then rudely shut the ticket counter and went to make herself a cup of tea.

When we explained that our passports were in our vehicle, which had since driven back to our hotel, he was dismissive and rude.

{"review_body": "Built by an obsessed monarch in the 5th century, Sigiriya or Lion Rock is an astonishing feat of engineering and construction. The most striking portion of Sigiriya, a terracotta and grey core of rock set in the cultural heart of Sri Lanka, rises a sheer 200 metres above a forested plain, its flattened summit sloping gently. A series of moats, ramparts and water gardens remnants of an ancient city spread out on two sides of the rock, with the remains of a pair of giant stone paws still guarding the staircase that leads to the summit, once occupied by a royal palace. Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982, Sigiriya is best preserved city of the first millennium, showing complex urban planning around the base of the rock, combined with sophisticated engineering and irrigation skills in the palace perched on the summit. It is considered it to be one of the oldest tourist attractions in the world with visitors recording their impressions in some of the earliest-known graffiti. For just two decades in the 5th century AD, Sigiriya rose to prominence following a power struggle between two brothers, and an act of patricide that saw the then king walled-up alive by his son, Kasyapa. Fearful that his defeated brother would return from exile to extract vengeance, Kasyapa shifted the capital to Sigiriya and in 477 AD, he ordered the construction of the magnificent city around the base of the rock, and decreed that his palace should stand on top, a fortress that would keep him safe from retribution.", "review_date": "September 7, 2014", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "Sigiriya World Heritage", "review_title": "Sigiriya World Heritage", "reviewer_name": "Ralini", "num_reviews_reviewer": "93", "place_name": "Sigiriya World Heritage Site"},

{"review_body": "This was one of the best places we visited in our 2 weeks around Sri Lanka. Moderate fitness level is best but, if not, by taking your time, resting regularly along the way, and drinking plenty of water, making the top should be achievable by most. Allow about 2 hours as there is plenty to take in along the way and views from the top offer a full 360 degree view of the landscape and countryside below. Going earlier, leaving the carpark by around 9am, should afford the clearest views from the summit. You start with a very pleasant walk along a flat well maintained path, surrounded by nice grassed gardens bordered by man made water canals. As you head towards the rock, you take in wonderful views of it. Once you have reached the base of the rock, it is a fairly steady and continuous stairway climb to the top but with plenty of places to rest as you take in nice views of the park below. Along the way you will also nice natural archways and interesting rock formations and caves plus areas man made, sculptured out for priests, the kings and guests. Frescos are in a closed in area on side of mountain to preserve them and must be seen. All of women and in very good condition. Beyond the frescos it is another climb of around 15 minutes to the stone lions' paws at the base of the final staircase to palace ruins on top of the rock. Take a rest here and motivate yourself to make the final ascent up the staircase to the top. As well as the ruins, the views are outstanding if you have a clear day.

The visit to Sigiriya was the most uncomfortable we felt throughout our whole stay as its one thing tipping a helpful guide but another thing when you have several people who insist walking all the way to the top and down again all expecting tips.

My advice is either be stern but polite as soon as anyone offers to help you up a single step as once you let them help you up 1 step you will never get rid of them. If you feel rude telling people politely to 'Go Away' then make sure you have plenty of 50-100 notes so you are not shelling out massive tips to an army of hangers on.

{"review_body": "Whilst staying in Kandy we took the opportunity to visit Sigiriya. I had booked a tour online back in the UK and hadn't really done much research into Sigiriya, other than establishing that it is a 200m high rock, so when we got to the site after a three hour car journey I was astonished to find an ancient palace built into the rock, accessed by over 1100 steps. It was over 30 degrees and just after 10am and I was already a bit hot and bothered so the prospect of climbing up this rock in the mid day heat was slightly worrying. It was totally worth it though. Don't get me wrong you need to be quite fit and healthy and certainly not afraid of heights but you don't have to be an athelete to get up there, just prepared to sweat a bit. The views on the way up are stunning and at the top you can really appreciate the scenery of what they call the cultural triangle. A few tips. The entrance fee is $30 per foreigner. This is probably the most expensive attraction in Sri Lanka and the prices are hiked up for foreigners because the government know we'll pay. There are guides available who will take you up and explain the history behind the site which is worthwhile but they do expect to get paid at the end. I'd suggest not giving less than 1500 rupees as you may find they ask for more if you do. Take a couple of big bottles of water, you'll need it and protect yourself from the sun. There are monkeys on the site who will grab any food from you so keep snacks/packed lunches safely stowed away. If you can make the trip visit Sigiriya, its a must see.

The king only had a short life span as he took his own life when believed a false rumor of a defeat to his vengeful younger brother. with his the citadel was abandoned. and later the rock was used as a monastery by the monks.

The Sigiriya was one attraction we attended throughout our journey and was an amazing piece of history steeped into an architectural masterpiece.", "review_date": "", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "Guided tour with Upendra De Silva (Jetwing)", "review_title": "Guided tour with Upendra De Silva (Jetwing)", "reviewer_name": "Liz T", "num_reviews_reviewer": "2", "place_name": "Sigiriya World Heritage Site"},

{"review_body": "The museum is ordinary but the climb to the top of the rock and the view is exhilarating. There is not much that is intact by way of ruins and one wonders at the originality of the art work on the cave walls high up on the face of the rock. The hands intrigue me. The colours are quite reminiscent of art work I have seen in Italy from the 15th Century. Beware the steep winding stair case, the heat and the wasps. We hired a van -cheaper than a car and more comfy than a tuk tuk with a very polite quiet driver who didn't quite make the bowser at Sigiriya and had to go in search of diesel in a nearyby village to get us there.

{"review_body": "We spent the day in Sigiriya. we took a local train from Dambulla for just 30 rupees and arrived within 30 minutes. The entrance fee is 30 dollars per person which includes an entrance to the museum as well. The gardens surrounding the mountain are beautiful and if it is a nice day the views are incredible. The walk up isn't hard at all and doesn't take long. Although the museum was only built two ago it is a bitrun down which is ashame. By the way a deffinite highlight is the monkeys who are very cute and friendly. They aren't aggressive like in Thailand or china. A day well spent. In our opinion you don't need a private driver. Just do it like the locals and take the bus", "review_date": "September 4, 2013", "bubble_rating": ["4"], "tagline": "Wonderful experience", "review_title": "Wonderful experience", "reviewer_name": "tamarony", "num_reviews_reviewer": "11", "place_name": "Sigiriya World Heritage Site"},
{"review_body": "Sigiriya is a world heritage site full of culture and history. Climb the rock to be at the top for sunset. It is an incredible view any time, but the sunset on a clear day is the icing on the cake. The climb can get a bit overcrowded, but at least that means that you are not exhausting yourself getting to the top. The frescos and mirror wall on the way up are interesting. The ruins are really intriguing. How a community could live in palatial surroundings on top of this rock is beyond imagination. Our driver ensured that we were there at the right time.

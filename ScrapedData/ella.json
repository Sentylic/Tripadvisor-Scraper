{"review_body": "Amazing views! Easy to walk to from Ella. Took about 30-40 minutes, saved us some cash by not getting yet another tuk tuk! Fairly busy but not too bad, got some great pictures. A few restaurants once you get back down where you can relax with a cool drink. The walk was easy to moderate, we are both young and fit. May be a struggle for others. There are 2 peaks, the second requires some scrambling. We walked this around mid morning and got sunburnt with cream on so maybe consider an earlier or later walk. I\u2019m terrified of snakes and unfortunately there was a snake charmer sat on the road side on the way down, he stopped charming once he saw me distressed and my boyfriend asked him to stop!

It is a must-do experience for travelers to Ella, adults, elderly in a good condition and children alike, because this is what Ella is so famous for: the views! Best time to visit is during the early morning hours to have the clearest views and the heat will not beat you as hard as during midday and afternoon. Easy to find.. Go to 98 Acres Hotel on foot, by bus (Passara direction), by tuktuk or by scooter, whatever you prefer. There is a direction sign to Little Adam's Peak near the hotel. The footpath after the entrance gate is very easy to walk and offers you wonderful views on the tea gardens on the slopes of the hills. At the end, right in front of you you'll find a staircase with roughly 300 steps which brings you to the top. The views on a clear day are stunning. On the right sight you can see the famous Ella Rock, it can't be missed. On the summit of Little Adam's Peak there are two small Buddha Statues and when you look left at it you'll notice that this mountain has an extension of several more small peaks. If you want to go there, you must consider that part is a far more strenuous hike and not suitable for for children. Take the same way back to the entrance gate. If you take your time staying at the top and taking pictures on the way it will take you about 2 hours. Take a water bottle and some snacks. Coming back to the entrance gate and turn right, follow the entire path to the end end you will reach the main road. If you plan to visit the Nine Arches Bridge, cross the road and you'll find a trek you can follow. It will lead you to the direction of this bridge.

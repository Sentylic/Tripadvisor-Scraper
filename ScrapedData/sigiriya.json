The rock/citadel is an ancient monument with a fascinating history and it looks spectacular even from a distance. I visited with a friend during a short tour (we were attending a conference). She climbed the rock, but because I have bad knees, I felt I was not up to the climb. It was very steep, and a continuous line of people walking up. Observing the well laid-out, rather beautiful grounds, with statues and lovely trees, I also noticed the continuous flow of huge tourist buses (mostly Chinese). This concerned me; as a World Heritage Site, it might become degraded if this continues; they should probably limit numbers. Instead of climbing, I took a lovely tour of the area via \"tuk tuk\" (it was raining, on and off) and enjoyed the quiet beauty of the natural surroundings - many birds, a huge lizard and monkeys! My friend said that she really appreciated having her own guide, as she was a little nervous about the climb. She said he was really good but of course she had to tip him extra. Still, this is one of those \"must see\" places in Sri Lanka. What I loved about it was the amazing views of the rock from different vantage points.

We managed to climb up and down within 1hr 20mins, this definitely wasn't easy for me to do so quickly as I tried to keep up with my Husband powering up the stairs. There are ALOT of stairs!! They're narrow steps too and slippery if you're not careful. About half way up you get to a metal spiral staircase which hangs off the side of the rock....half way up this I had a fight with myself deciding whether I wanted to turn back (people behind me so wouldn't have been easy) but kept telling myself to carry on as the realisation that I was hanging off a rock and really high suddenly set in. Something I clearly didn't think about before I started climbing the stairs! Neither me or my Husband are scared of heights but both of us had to tell ourselves to just concentrate on the steps and hang onto the railing on our way back down. Had I known I was climbing up those steps to see paintings on the wall and then climb back down again I might not have bothered but I'm glad I did it to tell the story all the same. Another part I found mentally challenging was the stairs after the lions feet, they too are metal, I decided it was easier coming back down them as I couldn't see the gaps in the steps like I could on my way up.

Yes there is a tourist and local price but almost every attraction I've been to in Asia has this tiered pricing system so I'm not sure why people have such an issue with it. I suppose if you don't have a guide then it is just a climb, a great view at the top with some ruins.

However, in an unfortunate turn of events, ( we hired a Tata Nano car, in which traveled at top speed of 60 - 70 km/H) we only arrived at 1pm to the citadel. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we ascended up the citadel, we had the place almost all to ourselves. We took a young guide who offered to tell us about the history of the rock for USD 10 (but only up to the lions paw) and we happily paid him rather than the uniformed guides who seemed surly and bored. We were there in mid May and the sun was not very sunny with strong winds that shoke the trees at the top of the plateau. Our young guide reassured us that there will be no possible wasp attacks on windy days such as these and we ascended quite safely. We did not encounter monkeys but we did see a lot of squirrels and little lizards basking in the occasional sun that peeked out of the cloudy day. The fresco s were absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. We spent about 30 mins gawking at the different women pictured on the caves. Letting your imagination go wild here is an absolute must. At the top, we had the entire place almost to ourselves and took about an hour exploring the pools and the grounds. The wind was really strong and the view was resplendent.

Also we found it was no problem for us to climb it I could see it would be a problem for others especially older people who might like to take lots of breaks and it is not really an option to do that at the moment. I feel if they are collecting that money from all the tourists and there are many, the authorities should install a lift . Also it would be helpful to tell people to bring plenty of water and maybe a few signs dotted around the place stating the climb may be difficult for some people. The other point I would like to make is when we came back down we were advised to go to the tourists carpark where we had to pass an area where the locals had stalls selling souvenirs, drinks, ice-cream etc. and they can be quite intimidating.

{"review_body": "Sigiriya was top on the list of places to visit during our trip to Sri Lanka. We had planned a 2 night stay in Kandy with one full day devoted to Sigiriya and Dambula, but we missed one aspect during the planning and landed in Sigiriya on a public holiday! So ended up climbing on a day over flowing with mostly local tourist. But nevertheless it was good fun. My husband who does not believe in unnecessary physical effort or exercise of any kind and my 5 year old son refused to climb, so i was left to do it all by myself. It is a slightly challenging climb if you are unfit, but very well worth the effort. The history behind the site is that of 2 sparring brothers, one of whom is chased away in to exile by the other brother, who establishes his empire from the top of the Sigiriya rock (200m high). It takes some effort and a lot of imagination to see how that would been possible in the absence of modern day technology. And is also a brilliant testimony to the heights (in this case literally) the greed and need for power could take one to! Before climbing to the summit, the first stop is a set of cave paintings, but this was rather disappointing due to the paucity of paintings and the damage that is visible. The next stop is the Lion platform which is a cut in the rock face and you see two giant paws (the rest of the structure is damaged).You then go on to climbing the top of the rock (which seems like an impossible feat when viewed from the ground!) On top you are greeted with brilliant views of the surrounding countryside. There are some remnants of the royal residence that once existed, mostly in the form of bricks and layouts. But these are not very interesting and most tourist spent time clicking photos and admiring the view. The way down is a lot easier and in no time you find yourself at the base of the rock. There are many other ruins at the base, but we gave most of these a skip as we had to make our way to the next stop at Dambulla after lunch. I would have liked to do the climb in a more leisurely pace and on a less crowded day, but nevertheless it was an interesting experience.

The price goes up almost every month - in March 2016 it was already up to 4260 LKR per person (approx 28.40 \u20ac) and if all you're after is the view you may be better going to the other rock a few km away that's only 500 LKR. However at Sigirya there is more than just the view. You begin with a walk through extensive gardens and ruins at the foot of the rock, and then begin climbing the steps. There are ample opportunities to stop and rest, take pictures etc. About one third (guessing) of the way up there is a spiral metal staircase up to a cave with beautiful paintings (no photos allowed) and another spiral staircase back down again. You cannot avoid doing these staircases, and for me they were one of the toughest parts as there is no way of stopping so you have to do the whole thing in one go to avoid holding everyone up. After this there are a few more flights of steps and you get to the Lion's Feet - a large area with benches and shade that is (guessing) about two-thirds of the way up. From there it's up a series of steps and metal staircases to the top. Not easy to pause from there up, but there are two staircases, one up and one down, and it is possible for folks to squeeze past if you need a breather. When the metal staircase ends and you're back to brick and stone you're only about 30 steps from the top. The top is astounding. Not only are the views absolutely breathtaking, but the ruins on the top are so extensive you wonder how on earth they ever got all the building materials needed up there, in the days before the metal staircases were built and they were just using footholds hacked into the rock. Do make sure you explore the ruins - there is a huge stone throne bench (facing leftwards from the direction in which you arrive up the stairs) which is worth seeing.

{"review_body": "I was very concerned about climbing Sigiriya. 1200 steps is a lot of steps for a 50+ year old who is mostly sedentary. Having done it- all of it- I can say that 1200 steps is a LOT OF STEPS but the challenge for me was more than aerobic capacity. The stairs for the last part of the climb (up the rock face) are bolted to the side of the rock and do shudder in the wind and with shifting weight. I was actually so scared on the stairs the fact that my legs were tired was hardly an issue. Coming down is even more scary if you have a fear of heights because you see the ground below you. As I was coming down, a woman on her way up had a complete meltdown and was screaming/crying. There is no real way to turn around on most of the stairs and in the end, her daughter basically just shoved/carried her to the top. On the way down, I just focused on the backpack of the guy in front of me and made it down with only a gasp or two when the stairs rattled in the wind. Was it worth it? Absolutely. The view of the area is certainly nice but seeing a kingdom built by people who carted bricks up stairs even more tenuous than the ones I climbed is amazing. The ruins are so well preserved that you get a good sense of what the palace was like when it was occupied. You can see a quick view of the top in many on line photos or in the Duran Duran video shot there. What about sights on the way up? The \u201cladies\u201d are quite beautiful and some of the best preserved frescoes from that era in the world. The mirror wall is interesting and a good place to see the oldest Sri Lankan writing. They are worth seeing even though you have to make a slight detour to see them. For me, the highlight was the palace at the top.

On the way up, I mentally wrote my will and pictured my life flashing before my eyes as I fell off the supposedly terrifyingly steep and narrow stairs. And then I actually did it. Don't get me wrong, the 4537892 steps were far from pleasant, but they were very manageable even for an unfit thirty-year-old like myself. Furthermore, there was always either a handrail or wall to grip onto and not once did I seriously fear for my life. The walk up took maybe 45 minutes and that involved me heavily panting the whole way and walking slower than some of the 3 and 60-year-olds who overtook me. We went at around 2pm so yes it was hot, we also wore thongs and I carried a handbag yet we made it up and down without a scratch!

On my climb there was a couple with toddlers slung on their backs and old folks with canes; there were also elementary school kids bounding up as well. Walk with a hat and a small knapsack for a bottle of water, snack and towel. The gardens at the base are also nice. Don't come all this way and not make a trip to the top once you are well enough to do so. There are local guides who offer there services at the base stairs (inside). I don't know how much they charge as I didn't take one, but besides english, I heard some speaking german, french and chinese. The info/history they give seem interesting and legit; but it's up to you take one (I didn't)", "review_date": "", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "Not to be missed", "review_title": "Not to be missed", "reviewer_name": "Trinivoyages", "place_name": "Citadel of Sigiriya - Lion Rock", "num_reviews_reviewer": "55", "via_mobile": 1},

{"review_body": "Sigiriya Rock has its charm. Standing all alone surrounded by greenery , it seems to beckon one towards it. Being a place that gets hotter as the day progresses , do reach the place as early as possible. I was the first to reach there at 6:30am but the ticket counter opened at 7am. Remember to carry your passport especially if you belong to SAARC nations. The ticket price is 2100 Lkr which is half of what tourists from other nations pay. Starting early has its benefits. Less crowd , more peace and one can enjoy a leisurely climb up the rock. There are guards at two points and they are extremely friendly and helpful. One first crosses the moat which runs around the rock and then comes to the sprawling garden which consists of ruins from bygone days. There are large hornet nests and several sign boards cautioning visitors.The climb mainly consists of steps . First set of steps are the stone steps which are pretty narrow and the remaining steps along the rock are metal along with a ramp which runs along a part of the rock face. People with knee problems can face difficulties. It was just 8 and the sun already hot however the view from the top is breathtaking. One gets to see the various hills in the distance and the green vegetation all around. The frescos are very similar to the ones that you can see in the Ajanta caves in India. I was told that some believe that it could be the same artist. The climb down is way easier but the stone steps being small and slippery can get tricky.

The frescoes midway are a sight to behold, along with the mirror wall. Try to be there before 8 am to avoid the noon heat. Wear comfortable footwear and preferably pants/shorts - dresses/frocks/skirts should be avoided as the sweeping winds throughout the climb and at the top might get you \"exposed\". Pack ample amount of drinking water and snacks but make sure these are carried in a back pack or cross body bags to ensure that both your hands are free to balance yourself during the climb. Ensure that your camera is securely slung around your neck or wrist. Gusts of wind sweeps in at unexpected places. Chances of dropping things are high. Umbrellas/hats wont be of any use because of the strong winds.....so be generous with the sunscreen :) We took nearly 4 hours to scale the rock and get back down. We had to miss the museum as we were pressed for time.

{"review_body": "Definitely worth doing if you are in Sri Lanka, although you wouldn't plan a trip just to see it as per Borobudur or Angkor Wat. Everyone's advice is to start early, but unless you are staying close (and we weren't) then you will end up being there during the heat of the day. It's certainly hot, but not unbearable (we live in Malaysia so we found it quite comfortable, but if you are not used to humidity then it will feel somewhat sticky). We had a guide (we paid him Rp 2000, which seemed to be the going rate when we asked around before going) and arranged that before we went. But you could certainly do the visit on your own: it's obvious where to go - the only two things to note route-wise is that you go up and then back down the spiral staircase to see the frescos and when you come back down from the top you follow the signs to the tourist car park (which is off to the left when you reach the bottom and was pretty well signed) if you are travelling in a car, because that is where your driver will park. The good news is that the tourist car park is much closer to the rock than the main car park, which is where you enter the site. I suspect that starting in the middle of the day means fewer people: despite it being a national holiday we didn't feel that it was overcrowded. Is a guide worth it? If you are not on a budget then I'd say yes: they can show you some interesting things that you'd otherwise probably miss (the old water fountain features, aspects of the frescos such as the fact that all the faces are different and there are some errors etc.), you do have peace of mind that you are headed the right way and we certainly didn't get hassled by anyone else. Things to bring: hat, sunscreen, comfortable footwear (someone's flip flop came off on the staircase and tumbled a hundred feet below), plenty of water. I also stuck a change of shirt in my bag and felt much more comfortable swapping into that before getting back in the car. The climb looks more daunting than it is - unless you are afraid of heights or very much out of shape then it's nothing to be daunted by (there are plenty of old folk, young children etc. who make it up without a problem). The pace of the climb is a leisurely one and if there are people on the staircases then you are going at the pace of the slowest, which might seem a little frustrating but in fact means that you should not be out of breath. Nice views at the top - don't forget to go up that last step on the top! Not quite sure what to say about the hornets: you can see the nests 20-30m off to the side of the last staircase but despite plenty of noise from the people on the rock there was no problem and the guide seemed relaxed about them. I think that you'd be most unlucky if they were a problem.

But the most amazing is the remnants of the citadel and how it is constructed on top of this rock so long ago. An engineering and human feat. I spent at least half an hour at the top to explore and absorb the views. As others have commented, I would also recommend take lots of water and a snack, wear lace up shoes for support and stability to climb up the many steps, have both hands free to use railings for safety , use sunscreen and wear a hat as it is exposed for almost the entire climb.

We are thankful on the travel date this did not happen since there was a no way for our group to complete 2 climbing experiences across a few hours on the same day. As our driver decided to lose his way on the way to Colombo, we reached here 5pm leaving us not much time to see everything. As it was getting late, the place looked a bit empty and there was not much archaeological information all over to read more info on each of the sites. There were some areas which seemed to need maintenance as there were heaps of soil indicating some kind of restoration work. The biggest challenge was to reach the top of the cliff. There were some stray dogs but they did not bother anyone. The Mirror wall did not resemble a mirror so we felt it bit of over rated. We had an anxious moment on reaching the Cliff when the guards asked for tickets which we had left with our group who decided to not climb along with us. The final ascent to the roof of the mountain took a lot of patience and tested our fitness level. We got advise from descending tourists that our effort would be worth it. The roof of the cliff does not have any structures as such since only ruins remain. The 360 degree view is mind blowing and the distance you see is endless. We could not see rock paintings up there since it was already 530pm and we were too late sadly. The descent was much quicker and we had to be careful not to make mistakes as we had some juniors with us. There is nothing much of artwork to look out for in general. We also had to give the museum at the cliff base (near the ticket office) a miss as it was too late and dark. They charge differently for locals, SAARC country residents and for any other countries.

My friend however having a balance issue due to a Lazy Vestibular Nerve, had to give up 2/3 or 3/4 the way up and go down early. The last portion after you reach the Lions Feet, is very much on the stair wells on the side of rock more or less, I passed one guy along the way as he was coming down and said, \"will I make it\"? His reply was very true and helpful, he said: \"absolutely, just keep looking down at the stairs, and not out all around you\". This was so true, as long as i focused on the next step, and didn't look around the fear of heights stayed away! I think i was too busy thinking how out of shape I was to think about the heights as well. Definitely needs a bit of a fitness level, which i thought i had, till put to the challenged. I persevered and made and glad i did, cuz the view was worth it!! Our guide bought the tickets and then seemed to have another guide he hired out of the money we paid him to drive/ guide us for our 2 week S. Lankan visit, at the sight who took us around, this guide was just at the sight and was fantastic with information, but he seemed to struggle with the climb himself as he had a bit of a tummy, i was worried he might have problem more than my friend with the balance issue!

I am sure that would have led to a much different review if I even had hands left to type. The big cage is a reminder of the large honey bees that have their nests alongside the mountain. The cage is available to take cover in should the bees become disturbed. Myth has it that the bees are incarnations of King Kasyapa's soldiers. We had a guide, but did not need him. A little reading before the trip would have eliminated the need for one. Along the way, \"helpers\" grabbed at our elbows, but we were aware of their intentions to extract more money from us, so we pulled away. It is expensive, around $30, to get in. Tourists pay dearly for their stay in Sri Lanka. The only negative comment I have is that we were led around quickly and missed the museum entirely. The guide made sure we were diverted through a pack of hungry gift sellers. One even chased us to the car trying to make a sale.

{"review_body": "It's hard to imagine any visit to Sri Lanka being complete without a visit to the ancient city of Sigiriya, a network of moats, pools and walkways ascending through giant boulders and terraces to the sheer face of a giant volcanic plug, the rock fortress, rising the best part of 500 feet above. The ascent of the rock fortress, via a series of stone and metal stairways, is recommended for anyone of even moderate fitness, and leads upwards through the gallery of famed frescoes and the Mirror Wall to the large platform, the Lion's Paw Terrace, at the foot of the Lion Staircase. Ascending between the two giant stone paws, an iron stairway then rises steeply to the summit, the site chosen by King Kasyapa for his palace. The panoramic views from here are well worth the climb, and there remains much to explore at the summit itself, where a network of paths, stairways and terraces lead around various points of interest, including the king's stone throne and the large pool, both hewn with ancient tools from the rock itself. The descent, on which - it goes without saying - care should be taken, follows a different route down from the Lion's Paw Terrace and skirts the wooded base of the rock before reaching the walk's end point, an opportunity to refresh and refuel and, should you wish, to purchase Sigiriya related merchandise.

So first of all - allow about 3-4 hours if you aren't sure of your fitness. it will take you longer. Morning is better as you will feel less rushed and it is cooler.

They will carry your backpack - your water - your camera etc. Also there are places where the stairs are steep and there is no handrail (in the beginning). The guide will help you up these stairs (lend a hand or shoulder). Also if you are less fit and walking along slowly - every guide will run up and pester you.

Also explained the history and significance of what we saw. I will be honest, there are times when it is very scary if you have any fear of heights.

After buying our tickets 7000 rupees we walked through the kings pleasure gardens with pools and fountains, which I'm told are still working but weren't that day, while Amitha went to park the car and met us at the boulder garden where the steps to the top of the rock go. Must admit seeing the rock from a distance I couldn't imagine how one could get up there but it wasn't half as hard as I had expected from what other people had written (and I'm 65 not a twenty year old!). The first steps are carved into the rocks then there is an iron walk way and stairs attached to the rock face. Halfway up is the \"mirror wall\" with beautifully conserved wall paintings of women, preserved from the weather by an overhanging rock. The last part of the climb, entering through lions oaws, was in the sunshine but it didn't take long and we were on the top looking over a fantastic 360\u00b0 view of forests with an occasional stupa or statue of Buddha shining white in the distance and the lay-out of the gardens below us. There are only low walls left as remains of this palace fortress but enough to get a good idea of what it must have been like. Going back down was a lot quicker and on the way back to the car we walked through other parts of the gardens with caves and strange rock formations, the most noticibale the cobra's head. It is well worth the money (which goes to it's upkeep) and the walk up. My advice is do it in the morning when you will find most of the climb in the shade.", "review_date": "", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "Sigiriya rock", "review_title": "Sigiriya rock", "reviewer_name": "pocopa", "place_name": "Citadel of Sigiriya - Lion Rock", "num_reviews_reviewer": "41", "via_mobile": 0},

Having said that we climbed it in the heat of the day taking plenty of water. The advantage was that we avoided the crowds which appeared later in the day. There are steps all the way and half way up there is a gallery of rock paintings of very nubile young maidens reached by a steep staircase.. Fortunately their somewhat inaccessible location meant that the escaped the destructive attentions of religious extremists through the ages. The view from the top is magnificent and well worth the climb. The gardens at the bottom are worth a leisurely stroll past ornamental lakes and gardens. Allow about 3-4 hours at a leisurely pace.

{"review_body": "You have to go here as it's pretty unique. It's similar to Ayer's rock in that it appears to have been dropped there from outer space. It's slightly higher than Ayer's rock however. The cost is high 3750 rupees for tourists, but I think it was worth it because of it's rarity. You first go through the walled gardens up to the rock. There's then a climb which starts off ok, and then get's genuinely scary. The climb involves walking up a metal spiral staircase to a cave and then up another metal staircase to just below the summit, then things get seriously scary. The metal staircase from there up has small steps and 2 handrails but is otherwise exposed to the sheer drop below. The steps have gaps between them so apart from looking straight down at the steps, anybody who suffers from vertigo isn't going to have a good time. On the way down, I could see that if you slipped on the steps, you could fall down the steps and through the gap at the bottom to certain death. What you do have to avoid this fate, are 'guides' who are there looking for nervous prey. To be fair, the guide was useful not only at getting me up and down the steep bits but also taking me on a tour of the top and pointing out the water tanks, the dancing hall,the king's palace etc. The going rate for a guide is 500 rupees but they don't mention a price when they first start assisting. I knew the rate beforehand, however. When I'd go past the worst bit on the way down I thanked the guy for his time at which point I suggested 300 rupees and he said \u00a320 was the going rate! I moved to 500 rupees and he insisted on 1000 rupees. I said tough luck and gave him 500 rupees and he went away muttering under his breath. I don't feel sorry for the guy, I'm sure he's got \u00a320 from somebody in the past, but not specifying a rate straight up and then demanding what is a fortune for a Sri Lankan is not an acceptable way of doing business.", "review_date": "", "bubble_rating": ["4"], "tagline": "Not for vertigo sufferers!", "review_title": "Not for vertigo sufferers!", "reviewer_name": "macehill", "place_name": "Citadel of Sigiriya - Lion Rock", "num_reviews_reviewer": "69", "via_mobile": 0},

As a life long vertigo sufferer, with a true fear of heights, this did not fill me with joy. Unfortunately the weather on the day we went in January was extremely damp and overcast, with very poor visibility. On arrival, we found the whole site swarming with (apparently 700) students/future leaders under the aegis of the army. They were amazingly polite & well behaved with no pushing, shoving or jostling, but there were so many of them that it took them a long time to make the ascent. We went to the museum first, which was rather uninspiring, and then wandered around the beautiful lower water gardens, which I enjoyed. Psyching myself up to make at least part of the climb, we set off, me with heart in mouth. By then the majority of the youngsters had bounded up the spiral staircase and on to the next part. I had read the guidebook, which didn't really make clear how vertical the metal ladders were up the face of the rock. My husband and our lovely guide/driver cajoled me up to the mirror wall and the frescoes, knowing that I was really keen to see them. I won't say it wasn't an ordeal, and coming down was worse. When I made it to the Lion Terrace and saw the almost static queue up the next lot of steps, which were not enclosed, but had only a waist high rail, I knew I had done my character building exercise for the day. Conversation with several others at this stage confirmed I was not alone! The thought of standing for ages looking out over nothing and not being able to flee back down was just too much, and sitting down and closing one's eyes wasn't an option either! I suggested husband and guide went on up alone, but what with the enormous crowd and the very poor visibility, they declined. We took a different, very interesting route back through the beautiful ruins & rock formations, and I feel slightly wimpy at not having gone on right to the top, but illogical though vertico is (you know you can't fall, but you feel you are) it is a very real feeling and despite years of trying to overcome it, I didn't feel absolute terror or making an idiot of myself was justified! Apparently the king who built it did not himself like heights, and after being taken up to the Lion Terrace in a litter, went on up by some interior route with high walls - I wish. So, vertigo sufferers be warned - the guidebooks are rather airy about this aspect!

After purchesing the ticket and going to the ticket processing booth at the entrence I was told I can not enter without ID. Non of this information was writen on any board leading up to the enterence.the beauty of Sigiriya is tainted by how disorganised the entrence is.Its not difficult to list all the rules and regulations before having to walk 1.5 to enter the attraction. It was a sad and extreamly disappointing experience. The tourists are treated like royalty but I felt as though I was a second class citizen in my own country.

When i reached Sigiriya around 7.30 a.m it was just great for me to climb the historic rock. It took me less than an hour to reached the top and the view was awesome. I wore a suit to protect me from wasps as recommended by the officials who were on duty.

{"review_body": "The day we arrived via 10 day tour with private guide, our guide set us up with a local guide who exclusively works at Sigiriya Rock. We arrived very early, as our guide urged us to do. Good decision, we beat the crowds and the heat. The Sigiriya guide , whose English was (to our surprise) immaculate, may not have looked as we expect a pro Guide to look, however, don't let looks deceive you! Did this man DELIVER! From the history to other intricate details, be it architecture, politics, religion or how they built the structure! FANTASTIC!!! His narration was so colorful, his demeanor so caring and attentive , he gave us so much more than we could have ever read in any guide book.Anyone on who posts not to trust the guides at the bottom of the rock... sorry, but I hope ,this information does not prevent people like our guide from making his decent living, he earned every rupee and make this visit an unforgettable one. I am sure there are good and bad ones, ours was phenomenal. The stairs for us was not a big deal, we are very athletic. But we saw other folks huffin and puffin away..(frankly,sometimes it was borderline comical, ;)). Especially when it got hotter during the day. If you're not the fittest, be prepared that this may be a good 3 hour visit if not more and lots of climbing stairs.... Yes ,they do sell artifacts, like in so many other sightseeing places, at the bottom of the Rock, and yes, we bought a beautiful wood carved elephant jewelry case, which we negotiated down to a 1/4 of the original price. It' s on my office desk and I do enjoy looking at it every day. No made in China here, supported local business. The steps can be challenging for some. If you are afraid of heights, this is not the place for you. On top of the rock you see the old pool, the remnants of ruins of a palace, and aaaah, the VIEWS! The cave frescos are interesting and yes, they are frisky, lol. The stories our guide told us about the monks, the crazy \"King\", how this palace was built upon this steep rock, unbelievable, we would have never paid attention to the giant boulder still sitting on rock stilts , ready to be pushed off the mountain, should the enemy ever arrive..... We soaked in the views and the wonderful breeze, the colorful tales and imagined how life must have been up here and then descended passing funny-looking tourists in 'bee suits' that they sell at the bottom of the rock. I laughed it off as a tourist trap, but then we were informed different by our guide. The week we visited, there had been 60 incidents of injured tourists , some of them ended up in hospital care. There are gynormous hornet nests (I read somewhere that may not be hornets though but wasps, not sure) hanging to the left and not too far from the last set of stairs. You have to take a look from the ground up, never seen anything like it. That day nothing happened, but the guide told us that the hornets get aggravated by loud noise and high winds, in worst case, the entire swarm will follow their victim anywhere..... we did not get a 'bee suit' but I guess I can understand the 'better safe than sorry' attitude of some, especially if you allergic..Our guide also told us that they regarded as the 'Guardians of the Rock' and therefore the nests remain. Leaving the rock, our guide took us to what was once a natural rock pool. It fills up during heavy rains. Cool stuff! His charge for this tour was beyond ridiculous, we tipped him triple of what we had agreed upon and it was still EXTREMELY reasonable considering the First Class Service we received!!! Sigiriya Rock was indeed the highlight of our trip. It is an incredible site, do not miss it, if you are somewhat fit and can make it up these stairs! Oh, after descending, we had a delicious drink at one of the stands, we made sure he uses only sealed-bottled water - and he does.

However, we felt that the cost of admission was very high. There used to be a collective ticket that covered all of the main Cultural Triangle sites but this has now been scrapped (as of January 2012), so you have to pay separately at each site. The cost here was US$30 which has made it, by far, the most expensive attraction we have been to in S.E. Asia and Southern Asia. You have to pay in cash (Rupees or US$) and you are not given any written guide or information sheet, which we felt was poor, given the cost. You do get a mini DVD as part of your ticket, but I won't know what is on it until I get home! Around the entrance, there are plenty of \"Guides\" who will readily latch on to you. We didn't use one as we have come across these so-called Volunteer Guides who then expect to be paid at the end. We gather that the cost of such a guide is about 1000 rupees (which is \u00a35).

{"review_body": "We left Colombo at about 4 in the morning and reached Sigiriya at about 9. Although we had booked the hotel, we wanted to climb the Sigiriya rock fortress before it was noon as it would then be difficult with the heat. We finished climbing and came down back to the ground by about 12 noon. There were wasp nests in the vicinity and the relevant officials were giving away thick jackets to those who wanted them. Nevertheless, if you do not make any noise as you climb up, a wasp would never attack you. Hence, the climbers do not have to be scared. Even if the wasps get active as you climb, if you remain still, silent and calm they will pass you by. So, we did not wear the jackets. We spent some time up on the rock plain and then visited the Sigiriya museum. It displays the vast history of the place in a very detailed manner with archaeological findings. There was a skeleton that belonged to an era 5000 years ago. After visiting the museum, we had lunch and checked in at the Sigiriya Village hotel. We were treated really well and warmly. We spent the night there enjoying the pool and the aurvedic treatments. The following day, we enjoyed the beauty of the hotel, the ponds and the surroundings and checked out after lunch. Then we climbed the Pidurangala mountain which is NOT usually frequented by travellers. Up on the pinnacle you find an old Buddha statue and a carving on a rock which belongs to 1 - 3 B.C, basically two centuries prior to the Sigiri Kasyapa era. If you visit this place, you will be able to find creatures that have got accustomed in nature and colour to the surrounding environment.

{"review_body": "This was one of the first sights I visited whilst on a ten day tour of Sri Lanka. I approached it with trepidation as I am not a lover of heights. My 2 teenage kids wife and I arrived at about 9.30 and it wasn't too busy or overly hot. My only disappointment was that I was unable to buy a cultural triangle ticket from the ticket office which would have included this sight and others at a reduced rate as they do not acept cerdit/debit cards.. CASH only, I barely had enough to cover the entrance to this sight alone. Be mindful that tourists are exploited and that you will pay the same sort of prices you would to enter attractions in the UK and USA. The locals will pay a much reduced fee. For example a tea picker only earns about 400-500 rupees a day ($5/ \u00a33)and will therefore only be expected to pay about 200 rupees to enter a sight or temple. You will be charged to use the toilet facilities but at least you will be provided with paper. Wear sensible shoes, although I saw people do it barefoot and in flipflops and take some water. A couple of hours should be enough if you are reasonably fit. There were groups of school kids 7-9 yr old shimmying up it with no problem. There are touts who will go away if you are firm, just don't show an interest in anything they are trying to sell or let them take your photo. I made it half way before giving in to my fear of heights. My daughter made it to the top and made the mistake of having her photo taken. She was hounded all the way down the stairs but the tout soon disappeared when confronted by me. This should be an enjoyable experience which on the whole it was. I got chatting to a group of older schoolgirls who were surrepticiously photographing my blue eyed blond haired son and we all had a good laugh.", "review_date": "May 14, 2012", "bubble_rating": ["3"], "tagline": "On Top Of The World..

{"review_body": "Though it's one of the more pricey attractions (US $30 per person), and although it is a very strenuous climb to the top, the ancient rock fortress of Sigiriya is well worth it! Upon arrival, be prepared to be approached by numerous guides offering their services to take you to the top. The 1st time we went, I used such a guide and it was well worth it. They are friendly and are very knowledgeable about the fortress, the surrounding areas and its history. 1st make sure you set a price in advance! They will tell you \"let let me take you around, I'll give you a great tour and then you can tell me what you think it's worth at the end\" SET the price 1st or be prepared to have them tell you it's 2500 rupees (around $25). We paid $10. Also, if you decide to forgo a guide, you will be approached probably several times (at least) by guides that will point out facts about the area you are standing in - they will then 'join' you and unless you tell them \"no, you're on your on\" they will stay with you and expect some payment (this is what happened on our 2nd visit). But beyond the slight hassle of 'guides', you will find yourself quickly overwhelmed by the physical enormity of this place and the beautiful attributes that abound here. From the pools that King Kassapa built for his concubines (supposedly he had around 500) to the giant Lion paws, remnants of a once massive statue that you pass through as you make your way up the many steps to the top, there are wondrous things to see everywhere. Sigiriya is especially well known for its ancient frescoes painted high up within indentations in the cliff faces - absolutely amazing to think that these were done around the fifth century AD and with nothing more than ropes and bamboo ladders to get up there. Also, be sure to ask your guide about the defense mechanism that King Kassapa employed to protect the stronghold (you can see it - a massive boulder on staged, smaller rocks - these rocks could be hammered away allowing the giant boulder to crash down the hillside into attackers below). Despite the arduous climb, there are numerous stopping points all along the way and yo can certainly (and should) time your rests accordingly. (one important point - BRING water - there are no facilities and no water for sale). From the outset of your journey, you will find spectacular views but nothing compares to the top where you have a truly amazing 360 degree view of the lands all around. To the south you will see the mountains that house Kandy - to the Northwest you can see virtually all of the way to Anuadhapura and to the Northeast, the jungles of Minneriya and the lake that sits next to the ancient city of Polonnaruwa is visible. It is simply breathtaking. Good news on the trek down too - you don't go back the way you came. There's a shortcut and although you do come down part of the same way, the trip down is much shorter.", "review_date": "March 19, 2012", "bubble_rating": ["5"], "tagline": "Worth the climb!\"", "review_title": "Worth the climb!\"", "reviewer_name": "Mike S", "place_name": "Citadel of Sigiriya - Lion Rock", "num_reviews_reviewer": "4", "via_mobile": 0},

We were a family of 4 (2 x teenagers) & as you walk through the water gardens and look up the impressive rock - you do wonder how you will get up there! I suggest getting there early, you can take your time, not feel pressured and if you are nervous of heights you can take it in your stride. It really is a quite unbelievable experience. The walk to the base of the rock whilst tiring is by no means arduous. What follows next is walking up essentially a spiral caged stairwell and entering caves to see the various paintings / images. It is a fabulous vantage point to look around before you enter the cave. You then leave by way of another caged stairwell descending to the marble wall. I think this is the hardest part of the trip, it just seems more exposed and because there may be lots of people you may feel rushed.the trick again is to just take your time & you'll thoroughly enjoy it. From there you climb to the Lion Paws courtyard and through the entrance up the steps to the top of the fortress. The views are stunning & assuming it's a clear day it's worth taking in the views and absorbing the surrounds.

We had a guide that took us up and he held my hand on the way down at the steep bits, but if he hadn't been there then there were other guys on hand to help you down for a small tip (LKR20). I can't believe that when the kind had his palace at the top he had guys carrying him up there, what strapping chaps they must have been. We had a clear day and so you could see for miles and miles from the top, it was soooo worth the climb I promise, so if you get an opportunity then do go. One thing I'd say though is that everyone kept saying how lucky we were it wasn't raining as it is very slippery when wet - so if you are going on a wet day then have lots of LKR20 notes with you to give to the guys that help you up and down the stone step bits which are quite deep in some areas, so really you need to hold on to something - unless you have great shoes and better knees than me.", "review_date": "", "bubble_rating": ["4"], "tagline": "Worth the climb for the sense of achievement and the reward of the views", "review_title": "Worth the climb for the sense of achievement and the reward of the views", "reviewer_name": "Heffalump321", "place_name": "Citadel of Sigiriya - Lion Rock", "num_reviews_reviewer": "46", "via_mobile": 0},

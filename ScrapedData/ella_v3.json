In stead of going back to the center (left hand side) turn to the right (ask reception of the hotel if you are not sure) at the hotel reception and cashier.

Best time to visit is during the early morning hours to have the clearest views and the heat will not beat you as hard as during midday and afternoon. Easy to find.. Go to 98 Acres Hotel on foot, by bus (Passara direction), by tuktuk or by scooter, whatever you prefer. There is a direction sign to Little Adam's Peak near the hotel. The footpath after the entrance gate is very easy to walk and offers you wonderful views on the tea gardens on the slopes of the hills. At the end, right in front of you you'll find a staircase with roughly 300 steps which brings you to the top. The views on a clear day are stunning. On the right sight you can see the famous Ella Rock, it can't be missed. On the summit of Little Adam's Peak there are two small Buddha Statues and when you look left at it you'll notice that this mountain has an extension of several more small peaks. If you want to go there, you must consider that part is a far more strenuous hike and not suitable for for children. Take the same way back to the entrance gate. If you take your time staying at the top and taking pictures on the way it will take you about 2 hours. Take a water bottle and some snacks. Coming back to the entrance gate and turn right, follow the entire path to the end end you will reach the main road. If you plan to visit the Nine Arches Bridge, cross the road and you'll find a trek you can follow. It will lead you to the direction of this bridge.

The first uphill walk was lovely since the trail is in between the tea plantation. This will go for 10-15 minutes before reaching the concrete steps that leads to the peak. My main goal is to see the sunrise as travellers describe incredible but unfortunately it rained just before I reached the top. I didn\u2019t see the sunrise but instead I was enveloped by hazes that quickly come and go which feels awesome. Some fogs are really thick and heavy that one moment it got me scared, I was blinded and I can\u2019t see the valley below. It is unforgettable. Love this place.
